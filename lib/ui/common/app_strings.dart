    '''In the realm of competitive programming, the mighty gods of code did gather 
To build a platform, called Pantheonix, where coders could test their skills and measure

First, there was Midgard, the realm of the frontend, where mortals could see 
The problems, the leaderboards, and the submissions, for all the world to be

But behind the scenes, in Asgard, the backend did reside 
Where the true power of the platform did reside

There was Odin, the all-father, the API Gateway, who controlled the flow 
Of data between the realms, ensuring all did go

Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, guarded the gates 
With his Auth Service, ensuring only the worthy did pass through the gates

Hermes, the messenger of the gods, did also play a role 
With his FTP Service, ensuring the test cases were uploaded, downloaded and whole

Anubis, the god of the dead, did weigh the submissions in his scales 
With his Evaluation Service, ensuring the code did not fail and analyzing the data, creating historical statistics

Enki, the god of wisdom, did create the problems with care
Ensuring the challenges were fair

Thus the platform did run, with the gods at the helm 
Ensuring the coders did test their skills and overwhelm

And so the balade of the competitive programming platform Pantheonix did end 
With the gods of code, ensuring the mortals did ascend. ''';
